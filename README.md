Create a CRUD service with Golang:

Your task is to develop a simple CRUD service in Golang for managing items. Each item should have a unique ID and a name. The service should support the following operations:

Create Item: Add a new item to the system.

Get Item by ID: Retrieve an item by its ID.

Get All Items: Retrieve all items. Additionally, implement a query parameter to filter items by name.

Update Item: Modify an existing item by its ID.

Delete Item: Remove an item from the system.

Feel free to implement it as you see fit, but simplicity and readability will be highly valued.
